## 3634. Minimum Removals to Balance Array

### Description

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

An array is considered **balanced** if the value of its maximum element is at most `k` times the minimum element. That is, `max(remaining) <= min(remaining) * k`.

You may remove any number of elements from `nums` without making it empty. Return *the minimum number of elements to remove so that the remaining array is balanced*.

> **Note:** An array of size 1 is considered balanced because its maximum and minimum elements are equal, and the condition always holds true.

### Examples

#### **Example 1:**

**Input:** `nums = [2,1,5]`, `k = 2`

**Output:** `1`

**Explanation:** 
Remove `nums[2] = 5` to get `nums = [2, 1]`.
Now `max = 2`, `min = 1` and `max <= min * k` as `2 <= 1 * 2`. Thus, the minimum removals required is 1.

---

#### **Example 2:**

**Input:** `nums = [1,6,2,9]`, `k = 3`

**Output:** `2`

**Explanation:** 
Remove `nums[0] = 1` and `nums[3] = 9` to get `nums = [6, 2]`.
Now `max = 6`, `min = 2` and `max <= min * k` as `6 <= 2 * 3`. Thus, the minimum removals required is 2.

---

#### **Example 3:**

**Input:** `nums = [4,6]`, `k = 2`

**Output:** `0`

**Explanation:** 
Since `nums` is already balanced as `6 <= 4 * 2`, no elements need to be removed.

### Constraints

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10⁵`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10⁹`
* `1 <= k <= 10⁵`
